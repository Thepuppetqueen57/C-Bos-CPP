# C-Bos
 A command-line app made in C++ for fun.

 This used to be the main cbos but I rewrote it in python and now this is a side project

 This probably will almost never get updated btw

 Make sure to go check out [the main C-Bos](https://github.com/Thepuppetqueen57/C-Bos)

# How to use
 If you dont want to compile from source then just install gcc then download the latest version of cbos-cpp and run the exe

 Then type `help`

# How to compile from source
 Install [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) installed (search up a tutorial on how to install it)

 Then run `g++ main.cpp -o main -lws2_32` in the cbos dir and it should be compiled!

 Also the exe only works on windows and I'm using a windows only lib to make httplib work sorry.

# Gcc
 Gcc is required to run this program. It has libraries that come with it that cbos-cpp needs.
