# C-Bos
 A command-line app made in C++ for fun.

 This used to be the main cbos but I rewrote it in python and now this is a side project

 This probably will almost never get updated btw

 Make sure to go check out [the main C-Bos](https://github.com/Thepuppetqueen57/C-Bos)

# How to use
 If you dont want to compile from source then just install gcc then download the latest version of cbos-cpp and run the exe

 Then type `help`

# How to compile from source
 Install [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) installed (search up a tutorial on how to install it)

 Then run `g++ main.cpp -o main -lws2_32` in the cbos dir and it should be compiled!

 Also the exe only works on windows and I'm using a windows only lib to make httplib work sorry.

# Gcc
 Gcc is required to run this program. It has libraries that come with it that cbos-cpp needs.

# Discontinued
 C-Bos C++ has been discontinued as of september 16th 2024.

It got discontinued because on that date I switched to linux and this is windows only.

# Edit
 I don't feel like changing the readme so imma just add this at the bottom.

 This isn't windows only. It literally takes less effort to compile it on linux in fact.

 Still discontinued tho cuz I lost interest and I use rust now arhahrhahrh.
